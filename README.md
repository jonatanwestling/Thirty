# Thirty

A mobile implementation of the dice game "Thirty".

## Game Description

Thirty is a dice game where players try to score as many points as possible by rolling dice and selecting combinations that sum up to a target number each round.

## How to Play

- The game is 10 rounds.
- In each round, you roll 6 dice.
- You can re-roll any number of dice up to two times per round.
- After rolling, select combinations of dice that sum up to the round's target number (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12).
- Each valid combination scores points equal to the target number.
- The goal is to maximize your total score over all rounds.

## Rules

- Each die can only be used in one combination per round.
- You must use all dice to score in a round, or you score zero for unused dice.
- The game ends after 6 rounds, and the player with the highest score wins.
